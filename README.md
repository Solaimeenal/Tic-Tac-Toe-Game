# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Key Features:

✅ Intuitive GUI - Built with tkinter, providing a visually appealing and interactive interface.

✅ Error Handling - This code defines functions to print the board, check for a winner, and check if the board is full. The play_game function runs the main game loop, where players take turns entering their moves. The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full (resulting in a tie).

✅ Additional Information - Utilized the `random` module to provides various functions for generating random numbers, sequences, and making random choices.

✅Board Representation: The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, typically stored as a nested list or a 2D array.
✅Game Loop: The game proceeds in a loop where players take turns making moves until the game ends.

✅Player Input: Players input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol (e.g., 'X' or 'O').
✅Winning Condition: After each move, the game checks if the current player has won by checking for three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
✅Tie Condition: If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

✅Output: The game displays the current state of the board after each move and announces the winner or a tie when the game ends.
